# Digital Twin for Power-to-X

Green hydrogen production in Denmark heavily depends on wind farms and solar panels. This, however, has a lot of problems:
    - unstable cost due to the weather change
    - expensive selling price
    - unpredictable energy consumption & maintenance

There have been many AI-based solutions proposed but none were officially implemented due to the lack of a true model and/or missing critical data. To resolve this blockage, a graph-based digital twin is deployed as an optimal state estimator.

Please keep in mind that our work **does not** propose another solution to cheapen the green hydrogen, but rather a stepping stone to realize the existing ones.
